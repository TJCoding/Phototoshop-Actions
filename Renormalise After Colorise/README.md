# RENORMALISE AFTER COLORISE:- A Photoshop Action
=====================================================================

#### DESCRIPTION: Re-establishes the correct shading for an image that has been subject to _Colorise_ under _Filter/Neural_ Filters.

## INPUT REQUIREMENT
Two image layers comprising the following.

A _Background_ layer which is the original monochrome image.

A _Layer 1_ layer which is a colorised version of the original image.

The original _Background_ layer is the monochrome image originally designated for _Colorise_ processing.

The _Layer 1_ contents have been generated by selecting _Filter/Neural Filters/ Colorise_ and clicking _OK_.

## OUTPUT
An image comprised of a single _Background_ layer 

## UTILITY 
The final image when converted to monochrome should show improved correspondence to original monochrome image.

Processing has been designed under the assumption that any conversion to monochrome is achieved by 
application of the _Image/Adjustments/Black and White_ processing option (rather than by _desaturate_ processing).

## EXAMPLE
The following composite shows from left to right the original image before conversion to monochrome, the image recoloured from the monochrome original, and the image subsequent to processing by this Action.  The second row shows the monochrome versions of the respective images in the row above.

It would be expected that the recoloured image generated from the original monochrome image would look identical to that image when converted to monochromeitself. It does not look identical but the correspondence is improved by the application of this Action.
